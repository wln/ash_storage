# Changelog

## [v0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Initial project setup
- Server-side checksum verification on upload via `Content-MD5` (S3, Azure)
- `AshStorage.Service.Context.put_expected_md5/2` and `:expected_md5` field
  for plumbing the expected MD5 to services on both upload and download

### Changed

- Renamed `Context.put_upload_md5/2` to `put_expected_md5/2` and the
  `:upload_md5` field to `:expected_md5`. The field now serves both upload
  (sent as `Content-MD5`) and download verification (compared after fetch).
